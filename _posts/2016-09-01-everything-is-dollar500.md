# Everything is $500

There are a couple of non-essential things I keep my eyes open for... scan craigslist, visit garage sales, shop for... and no matter what it is I am looking for, it's about $500\.

A Playstation 4 so I can play No Man's Sky.

An Xbox One so I can play Fallout 4\.

A leather motorcycle jacket for summer riding.

A table saw.

A newer iPad Air or Mini to replace my old original iPad.

A shed for my garden tools.

A reasonable condition Telecaster.

All of these things are about $500, give or take, and yet they span a wide range of materials, construction, uses, markets, etc.

Why is everything $500?
