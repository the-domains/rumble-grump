  The way to address the problem of money in science is to move away from the
  grant system into a flat funding model. A lottery. Pitch your project. Get it
  voted on by your peers, and it gets into the funding lottery. Then projects
  are chosen randomly from the pool. Bam. Funding and publishing without the
  shitty lucre.

![Thinking about how to make money encourage good science, rather than work against it.](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aac0d935f154bf29de814b501538ee34/croprotate.png?cropheight=374&cropwidth=1125&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F7a0e68d3-e362-40a7-a3a5-b21030e5ef45.png&x=0&y=0)

# Patreon for Science

### Reading Vox's article on the "7 Biggest Problems Facing Science", every one of the problems can be refined down to MONEY. It skews what gets researched, how research is presented, when and where research is made available to other researchers and the public, and it leads to bad journalism.

The way to address the problem of money in science is to move away from the grant system into a flat funding model. A lottery. Pitch your project. Get it voted on by your peers, and it gets into the funding lottery. Then projects are chosen randomly from the pool. Bam. Funding and publishing without the shitty lucre.

So now let's go one step further. Let's set up a Patreon-like system to fund science projects. I'd be happy to give $5/mo to 25 different science projects I believed in, had a personal stake in, or thought should be funded. Congress won't approve funding for research into gun issues? Fine. I'll back the Gun Research Patreon. 

Bam. Funded. And as long as they continue doing their work, I'll continue funding it.

If I design this app, I'm going to call it Medici.
