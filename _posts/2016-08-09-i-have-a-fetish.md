# I have a fetish...

When I see empty office space of any sort, I invent the perfect business to go into that space.

It's a habit. A fetish. Like a stone you play with in your pocket.

I see an empty corner space in a brick building, and I think of the neighborhood, the parking, what kind of foot traffic this place would get... is this a retail location, or a service business? Maybe a coworking space?

Or that brand new multi-use building with the way-too-expensive "lofts", and the empty ground floor retail spaces... fuck the nail salons and Subway sandwich shops... what could really do well in this space, and provide a valuable community asset and business in the area?

I do this _constantly._

And my history of working at startup companies, and with Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors, and other startup funding models makes all these ideas actually viable. I have the experience and the connections. So what would I build here? Who would I employ? How would I retain employees at this business, and what business model would I create to ensure a consistent flow of income?

This is probably why I will never be rich. If I ever win a bucket of money, I'll invest in these ideas...

... which - when you think about it - will probably fail.

Because, after all, a business already failed in this spot, didn't it? :-)
