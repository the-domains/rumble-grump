### "Urnf...what?"

Ken managed to open one eyelid and scanned around the room. Light. Blinding. "God, how long have I been asleep _this_ time?" he thought.

The sunlight streamed through the holes in the curtain, lighting dust motes as they lazily floated in the air.

His face was buried deep in the pillow. As he lifted his head a line of spittle traced from the side of his mouth to a wet spot on the pillow.

"Ug... gross."

Using the back of his hand to wipe it away he realized the whole side of his face was wet with drool.

"Eeew. Yuck!"

The skin on his cheek still felt dead. He poked his face a little bit, but he still didn't have any feeling in his cheeks or forehead. Ken could feel his eyes and mouth, but they didn't feel... right. Like when your leg goes to sleep.

But he knew had been asleep for a very long time. It seemed to be the only thing he did anymore. The stiffness had settled deeply into his muscles and bones.

Levering himself into a sitting position on the edge of the bed he flopped his feet on the floor and listened to all his joints pop and click audibly. Man, he had crashed out hard. Felt like he'd been asleep for 18 hours this time.

"Damn. What time IS it?", he wondered. The clock radio next to the bed hadn't had any power in... well... a long time. He needed to look into that, but he hadn't gotten around to it yet.

Standing up he stumbled and caught himself on the chair next to the bed.

Willing his body into action he said, "Come on feet. Wake up. It's a shiny new day."

Shuffling into the bathroom he stood at the toilet for a minute with his dick in his hand before realizing he didn't have to pee. "What, nothing?" He waited another minute, shook his johnson experimentally once or twice, and then gave up and tucked it back into his pajamas.

Splashing some water onto his face he looked at himself in the mirror.

It was definitely still him, but... _different._

He knew hadn't shaved in a few days, but the stubble didn't seem to have grown at all. "Well that's an improvement" he thought, "no need to shave. Again."

He watched in the mirror as his fingers prodded the insensate skin of his cheeks, nose, chin, and ears. "That's soooo weird," he said.

He picked up the little digital camera he had on the sink, and scrolled through to a photo of his face in the bathroom mirror. Zooming in to the eyes, he held the camera up next to the reflection of his face in the mirror.

Looking closely back and forth between the photo of his eyes on the camera's screen and the reflection of his eyes in the mirror, he couldn't deny it any more. The color in his eyes was getting lighter and milkier.

"God. That is sooo weird," he mumbled, and took a photo of his face for reference.

Looking back through the last 5 or 6 photos on the camera, they were all the same face in the mirror, but as he went back further in time, his eyes got darker and darker. He was sure of it now; his eyes were losing pigmentation. Brown at first, they were almost a translucent grey now.

Ken put the camera back on the counter and shuffled down the hall into the kitchen. The light didn't come on as he opened the door to the fridge, and a cloud of flies flew out. Ken half-heartedly waved the flies away and looked inside the dark refrigerator.

An old piece of pizza sat on a plate on the top shelf, squirming with maggots. The milk carton and orange juice containers were bloated. Ken sniffed the air experimentally. Then, picking up the piece of pizza he held the squirming mass of maggots up to his nose and sniffed.

"Hm. Nothing." he muttered, puzzled. "Still not hungry, either."

Closing the fridge, Ken just stood there in the middle of the kitchen, not really looking at anything. Just... standing. He turned around and lurched over to the sink. His foot had gone to sleep again and it was like carrying a sack of flour attached to your ankle. "Well this is going to make things awkward," he thought, looking down at his unresponsive foot.

Making his way into the living room he looked at the huge butt-shaped divot in the middle of his couch, and flopped down. The couch was comfy. It fit him.

He looked at his hands resting on top of his knees, and their dirty finger nails. "I should do something about that," he thought. He looked the coffee table.

"Urnf... what?!?"

Ken's head jerked up. It was dark. Hadn't it just been morning? He absent-mindedly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. It was wet. He looked down. He had drooled on his chest. Again.

"Jeezus. I am definitely not well," he muttered.

But, he didn't feel sick, either. He felt... numb. His whole being felt like his face. Insensate. He experimentally prodded his cheek with his fingertip. Nope. Still nothing. No sensation.

"Weird."

Involuntarily, his head turned to the east. "What? What's that?" He had heard something. No, didn't _hear_ it... not with his ears. He... _felt _something. Compelled.

To a chorus of popping and snapping of joints, Ken laboriously extricated himself from the couch and stood up. Putting on the robe that was sitting next to him on the arm of the couch, he stepped into his slippers and walked through his apartment to the front door. As he walked down the hallway, his head kept swiveling to the east, for some reason. Like he was catching the scent of something, but it wasn't a smell... it was just... something... he had to go check it out. Now.

Ken's feet still felt like bags of flour, but he shuffled down the hallway and opened the front door of his apartment building. Outside it was dark, but was it warm? Cold? He couldn't tell, but his brain was pulsing with a need. East. His brain seemed to be telling him, "I need to go _THAT WAY._"

As he walked down the steps to the sidewalk, movement caught his attention out of the corner of his eye. He startled.

"Holy shit!" he mumbled under his breath as he took in the vision.

Mrs. Carsten, his 60-something year old neighbor was walking down her steps, too. But not walking. Shuffling. Or... limping. Or _something_. Her legs just weren't right. Her eyes were glassy white, and she was drooling. A little moan escaped her lips as her white eyes looked at Ken.

"Uh. Hello. Uh. Ma'am," Ken managed a basic greeting in the face of this... _what the hell was wrong with her?!?_

Her face turned east like she was listening something, and she continued her lumbering shuffle down the steps to the street.

Ken watched her as she moved away, and joined a larger group of shuffling, lumbering people, as they moved east.

Looking back at his open door, Ken felt a faint longing. Then, like a third grade teacher's hand on a distracted child's head, he felt his head turn to the east. He looked at the crowd moving away from him and felt compelled forward.

Picking up his feet and lifting them step-by-step in front of him, he moved forward into the shuffling crowd heading east.

Ken's last conscious thought as he shuffled away was, "Woah, this is so wei_uuuuuggggghhhhhh_ ...."
